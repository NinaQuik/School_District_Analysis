# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - Python, Pandas Library, Jupyter Notebook
## Overview
This module uses Python and Pandas Library to analyze performance trends across schools based on student funding, school size, school type and standardized test scores. The aggregated data is used to make education budget and prioritization decisions.

However, there is evidence that grades for Thomas High School ninth graders have been altered.  

The aggregated results are re-run after removing the Thomas High School ninth grader grades to determine if the performance trends have altered in any way due to the academic dishonesty.

The Data Set is comprised of both  [school data](Resources/schools_complete.csv) and [student data](Resources/students_complete.csv).

## Results
- **District Summary**
